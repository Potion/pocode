/**
 * callback() - User server actions
 * @context:	Websockets context
 * @wsi:	Opaque websocket instance pointer
 * @reason:	The reason for the call
 * @user:	Pointer to per-session user data allocated by library
 * @in:		Pointer used for some callback reasons
 * @len:	Length set for some callback reasons
 *
 *	This callback is the way the user controls what is served.  All the
 *	protocol detail is hidden and handled by the library.
 *
 *	For each connection / session there is user data allocated that is
 *	pointed to by "user".  You set the size of this user data area when
 *	the library is initialized with libwebsocket_create_server.
 *
 *	You get an opportunity to initialize user data when called back with
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_ESTABLISHED reason.
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_ESTABLISHED:  after the server completes a handshake with
 *				an incoming client
 *
 *      LWS_CALLBACK_CLIENT_ESTABLISHED: after your client connection completed
 *				a handshake with the remote server
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_CLOSED: when the websocket session ends
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_BROADCAST: signal to send to client (you would use
 *				libwebsocket_write() taking care about the
 *				special buffer requirements
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_RECEIVE: data has appeared for this server endpoint from a
 *				remote client, it can be found at *in and is
 *				len bytes long
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_CLIENT_RECEIVE_PONG: if you elected to see PONG packets,
 *				they appear with this callback reason.  PONG
 *				packets only exist in 04+ protocol
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_CLIENT_RECEIVE: data has appeared from the server for the
 *				client connection, it can be found at *in and
 *				is len bytes long
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_HTTP: an http request has come from a client that is not
 *				asking to upgrade the connection to a websocket
 *				one.  This is a chance to serve http content,
 *				for example, to send a script to the client
 *				which will then open the websockets connection.
 *				@in points to the URI path requested and
 *				libwebsockets_serve_http_file() makes it very
 *				simple to send back a file to the client.
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_CLIENT_WRITEABLE:
 *      LWS_CALLBACK_SERVER_WRITEABLE:   If you call
 *		libwebsocket_callback_on_writable() on a connection, you will
 *		get one of these callbacks coming when the connection socket
 *		is able to accept another write packet without blocking.
 *		If it already was able to take another packet without blocking,
 *		you'll get this callback at the next call to the service loop
 *		function.  Notice that CLIENTs get LWS_CALLBACK_CLIENT_WRITEABLE
 *		and servers get LWS_CALLBACK_SERVER_WRITEABLE.
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_FILTER_NETWORK_CONNECTION: called when a client connects to
 *		the server at network level; the connection is accepted but then
 *		passed to this callback to decide whether to hang up immediately
 *		or not, based on the client IP.  @user contains the connection
 *		socket's descriptor.  Return non-zero to terminate
 *		the connection before sending or receiving anything.
 * 		Because this happens immediately after the network connection
 *		from the client, there's no websocket protocol selected yet so
 *		this callback is issued only to protocol 0.
 *
 * 	LWS_CALLBACK_FILTER_PROTOCOL_CONNECTION: called when the handshake has
 * 		been received and parsed from the client, but the response is
 * 		not sent yet.  Return non-zero to disallow the connection.
 *		@user is a pointer to an array of struct lws_tokens, you can
 *		use the header enums lws_token_indexes from libwebsockets.h
 *		to check for and read the supported header presence and
 *		content before deciding to allow the handshake to proceed or
 *		to kill the connection.
 *
 * 	LWS_CALLBACK_OPENSSL_LOAD_EXTRA_CLIENT_VERIFY_CERTS: if configured for
 * 		including OpenSSL support, this callback allows your user code
 * 		to perform extra SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations() or similar
 *		calls to direct OpenSSL where to find certificates the client
 *		can use to confirm the remote server identity.  @user is the
 *		OpenSSL SSL_CTX*
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_OPENSSL_LOAD_EXTRA_SERVER_VERIFY_CERTS: if configured for
 *		including OpenSSL support, this callback allows your user code
 *		to load extra certifcates into the server which allow it to
 *		verify the validity of certificates returned by clients.  @user
 *		is the server's OpenSSL SSL_CTX*
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_OPENSSL_PERFORM_CLIENT_CERT_VERIFICATION: if the
 *		libwebsockets context was created with the option
 *		LWS_SERVER_OPTION_REQUIRE_VALID_OPENSSL_CLIENT_CERT, then this
 *		callback is generated during OpenSSL verification of the cert
 *		sent from the client.  It is sent to protocol[0] callback as
 *		no protocol has been negotiated on the connection yet.
 *		Notice that the libwebsockets context and wsi are both NULL
 *		during this callback.  See
 *		 http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_verify.html
 *		to understand more detail about the OpenSSL callback that
 *		generates this libwebsockets callback and the meanings of the
 *		arguments passed.  In this callback, @user is the x509_ctx,
 *		@in is the ssl pointer and @len is preverify_ok
 *		Notice that this callback maintains libwebsocket return
 *		conventions, return 0 to mean the cert is OK or 1 to fail it.
 *		This also means that if you don't handle this callback then
 *		the default callback action of returning 0 allows the client
 *		certificates.
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_CLIENT_APPEND_HANDSHAKE_HEADER: this callback happens
 *		when a client handshake is being compiled.  @user is NULL,
 *		@in is a char **, it's pointing to a char * which holds the
 *		next location in the header buffer where you can add
 *		headers, and @len is the remaining space in the header buffer,
 *		which is typically some hundreds of bytes.  So, to add a canned
 *		cookie, your handler code might look similar to:
 *
 *		char **p = (char **)in;
 *
 *  		if (len < 100)
 * 			return 1;
 *
 *		*p += sprintf(*p, "Cookie: a=b\x0d\x0a");
 *
 *		return 0;
 *
 *		Notice if you add anything, you just have to take care about
 *		the CRLF on the line you added.  Obviously this callback is
 *		optional, if you don't handle it everything is fine.
 *
 * 		Notice the callback is coming to protocols[0] all the time,
 *		because there is no specific protocol handshook yet.
 *
 * 	LWS_CALLBACK_CONFIRM_EXTENSION_OKAY: When the server handshake code
 *		sees that it does support a requested extension, before
 *		accepting the extension by additing to the list sent back to
 *		the client it gives this callback just to check that it's okay
 *		to use that extension.  It calls back to the requested protocol
 *		and with @in being the extension name, @len is 0 and @user is
 *		valid.  Note though at this time the ESTABLISHED callback hasn't
 *		happened yet so if you initialize @user content there, @user
 *		content during this callback might not be useful for anything.
 *		Notice this callback comes to protocols[0].
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_CLIENT_CONFIRM_EXTENSION_SUPPORTED:	When a client
 *		connection is being prepared to start a handshake to a server,
 *		each supported extension is checked with protocols[0] callback
 *		with this reason, giving the user code a chance to suppress the
 *		claim to support that extension by returning non-zero.  If
 *		unhandled, by default 0 will be returned and the extension
 *		support included in the header to the server.  Notice this
 *		callback comes to protocols[0].
 *
 *	The next four reasons are optional and only need taking care of if you
 * 	will be integrating libwebsockets sockets into an external polling
 * 	array.
 * 
 * 	LWS_CALLBACK_ADD_POLL_FD: libwebsocket deals with its poll() loop
 * 		internally, but in the case you are integrating with another
 * 		server you will need to have libwebsocket sockets share a
 * 		polling array with the other server.  This and the other
 * 		POLL_FD related callbacks let you put your specialized
 * 		poll array interface code in the callback for protocol 0, the
 * 		first protocol you support, usually the HTTP protocol in the
 * 		serving case.  This callback happens when a socket needs to be
 *		added to the polling loop: @user contains the fd, and
 * 		@len is the events bitmap (like, POLLIN).  If you are using the
 *		internal polling loop (the "service" callback), you can just
 * 		ignore these callbacks.
 *
 * 	LWS_CALLBACK_DEL_POLL_FD: This callback happens when a socket descriptor
 * 		needs to be removed from an external polling array.  @user is
 * 		the socket desricptor.  If you are using the internal polling
 * 		loop, you can just ignore it.
 *
 * 	LWS_CALLBACK_SET_MODE_POLL_FD: This callback happens when libwebsockets
 * 		wants to modify the events for the socket descriptor in @user.
 *		The handler should OR @len on to the events member of the pollfd
 * 		struct for this socket descriptor.  If you are using the
 *		internal polling loop, you can just ignore it.
 *
 *	LWS_CALLBACK_CLEAR_MODE_POLL_FD: This callback occurs when libwebsockets
 * 		wants to modify the events for the socket descriptor in @user.
 *		The handler should AND ~@len on to the events member of the
 * 		pollfd struct for this socket descriptor.  If you are using the
 *		internal polling loop, you can just ignore it.

 * @reason:	The reason for the call
 * @user:	Pointer to per-session user data allocated by library
 * @in:		Pointer used for some callback reasons
 * @len:	Length set for some callback reasons
 *
 *	Each extension that is active on a particular connection receives
 *	callbacks during the connection lifetime to allow the extension to
 *	operate on websocket data and manage itself.
 *
 *	Libwebsockets takes care of allocating and freeing "user" memory for
 *	each active extension on each connection.  That is what is pointed to
 *	by the @user parameter.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_CONSTRUCT:  called when the server has decided to
 *		select this extension from the list provided by the client,
 *		just before the server will send back the handshake accepting
 *		the connection with this extension active.  This gives the
 *		extension a chance to initialize its connection context found
 *		in @user.
 *
 * 	LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_CLIENT_CONSTRUCT: same as LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_CONSTRUCT
 *		but called when client is instantiating this extension.  Some
 *		extensions will work the same on client and server side and then
 *		you can just merge handlers for both CONSTRUCTS.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_DESTROY:  called when the connection the extension was
 *		being used on is about to be closed and deallocated.  It's the
 *		last chance for the extension to deallocate anything it has
 *		allocated in the user data (pointed to by @user) before the
 *		user data is deleted.  This same callback is used whether you
 *		are in client or server instantiation context.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_PACKET_RX_PREPARSE: when this extension was active on
 *		a connection, and a packet of data arrived at the connection,
 *		it is passed to this callback to give the extension a chance to
 *		change the data, eg, decompress it.  @user is pointing to the
 *		extension's private connection context data, @in is pointing
 *		to an lws_tokens struct, it consists of a char * pointer called
 *		token, and an int called token_len.  At entry, these are
 *		set to point to the received buffer and set to the content
 *		length.  If the extension will grow the content, it should use
 *		a new buffer allocated in its private user context data and
 *		set the pointed-to lws_tokens members to point to its buffer.
 *
 *	LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_PACKET_TX_PRESEND: this works the same way as
 *		LWS_EXT_CALLBACK_PACKET_RX_PREPARSE above, except it gives the
 *		extension a chance to change websocket data just before it will
 *		be sent out.  Using the same lws_token pointer scheme in @in,
 *		the extension can change the buffer and the length to be
 *		transmitted how it likes.  Again if it wants to grow the
 *		buffer safely, it should copy the data into its own buffer and
 *		set the lws_tokens token pointer to it.
